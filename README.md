## üöÄ How Does This Tool Help?

- **Enable Rapid AI Agent Prototyping:** Rapidly create AI agent prototypes using Azure AI and OpenAI's technologies, Agents, Assistants, Chat Completion, and Realtime APIs. This includes user-friendly configurability of different agents, built-in system functions, specific tool configurations, and LLM configurations.

- **Enhance Developer Productivity:** Streamline the agent development process through built-in middleware libraries and tools, utilizing tools in prompt engineering to automate your coding tasks and integrate AI capabilities into your copilot applications more effectively.


## üîäüé§ OpenAI Realtime

This section covers the Realtime capabilities for AI agent prototyping with OpenAI's Realtime APIs, focusing on speech and text input/output through real-time WebSocket communication.

Please note that these capabilities are offered as an experimental feature. They are intended primarily for exploration, demos, or proof-of-concept usage. 
We do not recommend using these features in production or business-critical applications until further notice.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Audio Interaction**: Use the Realtime API with speech input using predefined and integrated keyword `Computer` to trigger the conversation.
  - Using keyword can be helpful to optimize cost and reliability of your application. To create your own keywords, visit [Creating the Custom Keyword](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/custom-keyword-basics?pivots=programming-language-python). Currently only 1 keyword is supported.
- **Real-time Text Interaction**: Use the Realtime API with text input. The agent can respond back with audio or text.
- **Local Voice Activity Detection**: Efficiently manage audio data by detecting speech activities by using local voice activity detection.
- **Function Calling**: Customize the realtime agent with your own functions which runs asynchronously in the background.
- **Configurable AI Options**: Fine-tune realtime agent responses and behaviors with different options in Realtime API.

## ‚ú® Quick Start: Getting Started with the Tool

The Azure AI Assistant Tool supports **Azure AI Agents**, **Azure OpenAI Assistants**, and **OpenAI directly**. Follow the appropriate instructions depending on the setup you'd like to use.

### Step 1: Complete Azure (or OpenAI) prerequisites

Select the integration option that fits your scenario best:

#### ‚úÖ **Option A: Azure AI Agents**

- Create an Azure Subscription for free, if you don't have one yet.
- Deploy Azure AI Agents by following the [Azure AI Agents Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure).
    - You have the choice between a "**Basic**" or "**Standard**" setup option ([learn the difference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#choose-basic-or-standard-agent-setup)).
    - For advanced features such as **Azure AI Search**, **Azure Functions**, **Bing Grounding** and more, the **Standard** agent setup option is required.
- After deploying your Azure AI Agents resources, note down your project's **Project Connection String** from the Azure Portal's Azure AI Foundry Project Overview page.

#### ‚úÖ **Option B: Azure OpenAI**

- Create an Azure Subscription for [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ai-services/), if you don't have one already
- [Apply for access](https://aka.ms/oai/access) to Azure OpenAI Service in this Azure Subscription. Azure OpenAI Service is currently a limited access service so access is granted through an application process. Most applications are processed within a day of applying.
- Azure OpenAI Assistants models and region availability, see the [models guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) for the latest model and regional availability for Assistants.
- Create an Azure OpenAI resource on [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com) with one of the Assistants supported models from the models guide page deployed in that region

#### ‚úÖ **Option C: OpenAI**

- Make sure you already have an active OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
- Locate your API key from your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### Step 2: Install Python

The Azure AI Assistant tool requires Python >= 3.8 on your system. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Latest stable Python version is recommended.

Create a new Python virtual environment. Virtual environment is recommended for safe install the SDK packages:
 * On MacOS and Linux run:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
* On Windows run:
   ```
   py -3 -m venv .venv
   .venv\scripts\activate
   ```
---

### Step 3: Install the tool and dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to install all the necessary dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

### Step 4: Build and install azure.ai.assistant Python library (Optional)

We have included the `azure.ai.assistant` library currently within this repository as part of the alpha status of the project. 
The plan is to release library on PyPI for more convenience installation in future.

Build the wheel for `azure.ai.assistant` library using the following instructions, or use the wheel package provided under the repo's release tags directly.

- Python wheel and setuptools packages are required to build the library package. You can install them using the commands: `pip install wheel`and `pip install setuptools`
- Go to the`sdk/azure-ai-assistant` folder
- Build the wheel using following command: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
- Go to generated `dist` folder
- Install the generated wheel using following command: `pip install --force-reinstall azure_ai_assistant-0.x.xa1-py3-none-any.whl`
  - This installation will pick the necessary dependencies for the library (openai, python-Levenshtein, fuzzywuzzy, Pillow, requests)

---

### Step 5: Find and Copy API Keys and Connection Details

Based on your choice earlier, gather these required credentials:

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Azure AI Agents**

If you selected Azure AI Agents, you need the following from your Azure AI Foundry Project on Azure Portal:

- ‚úÖ **PROJECT_ENDPOINT** (mandatory, from Azure AI Foundry Portal Project Overview page)
- ‚úÖ **MODEL DEPLOYMENT NAME** *(Required when creating Azure AI Agent using the tool.)*


#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Azure OpenAI Assistants**
- Azure OpenAI **API KEY**, **ENDPOINT**, and **MODEL DEPLOYMENT NAME** from the Azure portal.

*(See image below for where to find keys and endpoint)*

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **OpenAI (Direct)**
- Your **OpenAI API KEY** from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

---

### Step 6: Setup Environment Variables

Set these environment variables according to your chosen setup:

#### üî∑ **If using Azure AI Agents:**

**Windows CMD**
```cmd
set PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<your project endpoint>
```

**Linux/MacOS (bash)**
```bash

---

#### üî∑ **If using Azure OpenAI Assistants:**

**Windows CMD**
```cmd
set AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your Azure OpenAI key>
set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<Your Azure OpenAI endpoint>
set AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-05-01-preview
```

**Linux/MacOS (bash)**
```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="Your Azure OpenAI key"
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="Your Azure OpenAI endpoint"
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-05-01-preview"
```

---

#### üî∑ **If using OpenAI:**

**Windows CMD**

```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your OpenAI key>
```

**Linux/MacOS (bash)**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="Your OpenAI key"
```
